### Data

#### No Data File

Since the size of data used in this homework is too big (> 100 MB) that Github rejects us to upload those files, I make a setting that Git would not track those data files (.csv format). 

Therefore, if you want to run this homework, make sure you download the data from Canvas first and put it inside the corresponding folder.

* `/data/Rental_Properties.csv`

#### Data Source

* [`/data/Rental_Properties.csv`](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elizabethveillon/us-rental-listings-summer-2021)
